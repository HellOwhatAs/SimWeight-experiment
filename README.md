# SimWeight

## Setup
[Python3](www.python.org) and [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)
```
python -m venv .venv
.venv/Scripts/activate
(.venv) pip install -r requirements.txt
(.venv) cd utils_rs
(.venv) maturin develop -r
```

## Roadmap

### Discussion 2024.1.23

- use float weight for edges
- sample k-shortset paths and drop positive samples by comparing list of edge-id
- have to write shortest path algorithm and k-shortest path algorithm that outputs edge-id
- Eq(7) in paper is wrong.  
  bpr loss is
  $$-\sum_{(i,j)\in G}{\ln  \sigma(\mathrm{length}(j) - \mathrm{length}(i))}$$
  where  
  $$i \text{ is positive path sample}$$  
  $$j \text{ is negitive path sample}$$  
  $$\mathrm{length}(i) = \sum_{e_k \in i} \mathrm{w}(e_k)$$

### Discussion 2024.1.25

- give up Yen's Algorithm due to it's time complexity

### Discussion 2024.1.27
- the time complexity of bidirection dijkstra is equal to dijkstra 😨

## TODO
- exist multiple shortest paths: does it match the requirement?
- smaller case to debug
- dynamic negative sampling
